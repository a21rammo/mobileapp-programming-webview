The assignment started with renameing the app by going into the **res/values/strings.xml**. The app was renamed to `Raman webview`.
There after I'd had to enable internet acces by going into the **/manifest/AndroidManifest.xml** and copied pasted `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />`.
I also changed the content_main.xml from `Textview` to `Webview`. I did also input inside the Webview an id `android:id="@+id/my_webview"`. Which was initiated in the **MainActivity.java** as private of the type WebView.
I enabled javascript with help of the id:

`myWebView = findViewById(R.id.my_webview);
myWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
myWebView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient());
`

A folder called asset which inside has a folder named html. The reasoning having another file inside of asset was because I thought that this folder might hold other type of asset also, such as img, css or javascript files. (**/assets/html/about.html**)
There after we called **loadUrl()** in both showExternalwebpage and showInternalwebpage. Which the method was called upon inside onOptionsItemSelected function.
